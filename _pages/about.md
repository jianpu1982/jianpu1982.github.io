Jian Pu received a Ph.D. degree from Fudan University in 2014, and B.S degree from Beijing University of Chemical Technology. Currently, he is a Young Principal Investigator at the Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence (ISTBI), Fudan University. 

I was an associate professor at the School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, East China Normal University from 2016 to 2019, and a postdoctoral researcher of the Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences in China from 2014 to 2016. 

My current research interest is to develop machine learning and computer vision methods for autonomous driving.

I am seeking highly-motivated students to work with me as Master's or Ph.D. candidates. If interested, please send your resume to me via email.
